    "*__Background:__ You're an electrical engineer working for a leading power systems research firm, specializing in transmission line protection and fault detection. Your team has compiled a dataset that includes measurements from various electrical power system transmission lines, documenting instances of faults and normal operating conditions. Your task is to develop a predictive model using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to detect and classify faults in transmission lines based on these measurements. This model will assist power system operators in maintaining system stability by enabling faster and more accurate fault detection, thereby minimizing power outages and enhancing the reliability of the power grid. The efficient operation of such a model is crucial for the protection of high-capacity generating power plants and the synchronized electrical power grids, ensuring the stability and robustness of the overall power system.*\n",

For example, it makes it keep track of its trainable parameters, you can swap it between CPU and GPU with the `.to(device)` method, where device can be a CPU device `torch.device(\"cpu\")` or CUDA device `torch.device(\"cuda:0\")`.\n",

Your team has compiled a dataset that includes measurements of various semiconductor and insulator materials, documenting their intrinsic dielectric breakdown fields alongside several experimental and calculated features. Your task is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the intrinsic dielectric breakdown field of a material based on its properties. This model will assist in the discovery of new materials with superior dielectric properties and contribute to the formulation of phenomenological laws governing electric breakdown field strength. By understanding and predicting dielectric breakdown, you aim to enhance the reliability and efficiency of electronic devices and systems that rely on these materials.*\n",
